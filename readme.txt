Files included:

-	Project_1.ipynb  : ipynb file to be run for getting the output.
-	Project1.py      : The python file with the combined python code from the different code blocks in the ipynb file
-	Project1_Report  : Detailed report of the project which includes the screenshots and findings.
-   Project1_1.html  : The html file of the ipynb file for reference of the working with all outputs.
-	Readme.txt       : the readme file to run the ipynb file.

Steps to run the program ipynb file:

-	Download the dataset from kaggle. The link to download the dataset is : 'https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/data'
-	Run the commented section of the Project_1.ipynb on Google Colab or Jupyter notebook to partition the data and reduce the size of the data to be manipulated, and change the file location.
-	Run the rest of the code blocks with the file location and path of the data stored on your system.

Note: Since the size of the file was huge (82Gb) and the UTD server and box came up with authentication errors with the file, the file was loaded from a local folder. Manual partition was not attempted so as to not hamper with the distribution of images different levels of the disease in the dataset.
