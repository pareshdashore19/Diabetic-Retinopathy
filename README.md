# Diabetic-Retinopathy
Deep Learning (CNN Implementation) for diabetic retinopathy detection

## Steps to run the program:

-Download the dataset from kaggle. The link to download the dataset is : 'https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/data'
-Run the commented section of the Project_1.ipynb to partition the data and reduce the size of the data to be manipulated, and change the file location.
-Run the rest of the code blocks with the file location and path of the data stored on your system.

Note: Since the size of the file was huge (82Gb) and the UTD server and box came up with authentication errors with the file, the file was loaded from a local folder.
